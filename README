Sudoku solver, using Knuth's X algorithm for the Exact Cover problem (using DLX)

What's been done:
1. Implement a sparse matrix using linked lists (2D lists)
	//Seems ok, but I only tested it twice (look the main file) =P

Next steps:
2. Implement the DLX functions
3. Test remove and insertion of lines and columns
4. Code the exact cover backtracking (using the lowest possible branching factor)
5. Test it with the wikipedia example
6. Apply it to sudoku (with wikipedia's 4 restrictions)
